## Introduction

Hello! My name is Mohammed Beltagy, and I'm excited to share my Dashboard Project with you. I used Pug, Sass, JavaScript, and Gulp.js to create a responsive website with eight pages. Throughout this project, I focused on organizing my workspace and unifying my Sass code to create a consistent design across all pages. I also utilized JavaScript to enhance the user experience and add dynamic functionality to the website. I'm proud of what I've created, and I hope you enjoy exploring my project.

- Unify my Sass code and use the same style for all pages without repeating the code
